// The parameters in closure expression syntax can be in-out parameters, but they can’t have a default value. Variadic parameters can be used if you name the variadic parameter. Tuples can also be used as parameter types and return types.

let names = ["Chris", "Alex", "Ewa", "Barry", "Daniella"]
var reversedNames = names.sorted(by: { (s1: String, s2: String) -> Bool in
    return s1 > s2
})

// The start of the closure’s body is introduced by the in keyword. This keyword indicates that the definition of the closure’s parameters and return type has finished, and the body of the closure is about to begin.

reversedNames = names.sorted(by: { (s1: String, s2: String) -> Bool in return s1 > s2 } )

// Because the sorting closure is passed as an argument to a method, Swift can infer the types of its parameters and the type of the value it returns. The sorted(by:) method is being called on an array of strings, so its argument must be a function of type (String, String) -> Bool. This means that the (String, String) and Bool types do not need to be written as part of the closure expression’s definition. Because all of the types can be inferred, the return arrow (->) and the parentheses around the names of the parameters can also be omitted:
reversedNames = names.sorted(by: { s1, s2 in return s1 > s2 } )
// It is always possible to infer the parameter types and return type when passing a closure to a function or method as an inline closure expression. As a result, you never need to write an inline closure in its fullest form when the closure is used as a function or method argument.

// Single-expression closures can implicitly return the result of their single expression by omitting the return keyword from their declaration.
reversedNames = names.sorted(by: { s1, s2 in s1 > s2 } )

// Swift automatically provides shorthand argument names to inline closures, which can be used to refer to the values of the closure’s arguments by the names $0, $1, $2, and so on.
// If you use these shorthand argument names within your closure expression, you can omit the closure’s argument list from its definition, and the number and type of the shorthand argument names will be inferred from the expected function type. The in keyword can also be omitted, because the closure expression is made up entirely of its body:
reversedNames = names.sorted(by: { $0 > $1 } )

// There’s actually an even shorter way to write the closure expression above. Swift’s String type defines its string-specific implementation of the greater-than operator (>) as a method that has two parameters of type String, and returns a value of type Bool. This exactly matches the method type needed by the sorted(by:) method. Therefore, you can simply pass in the greater-than operator, and Swift will infer that you want to use its string-specific implementation:
reversedNames = names.sorted(by: >)

// If you need to pass a closure expression to a function as the function’s final argument and the closure expression is long, it can be useful to write it as a trailing closure instead. A trailing closure is written after the function call’s parentheses, even though it is still an argument to the function. When you use the trailing closure syntax, you don’t write the argument label for the closure as part of the function call.
func someFunctionThatTakesAClosure(closure: () -> Void) {
    // function body goes here
}
// Here's how you call this function without using a trailing closure:
someFunctionThatTakesAClosure(closure: {
    // closure's body goes here
})
// Here's how you call this function with a trailing closure instead:
someFunctionThatTakesAClosure() {
    // trailing closure's body goes here
}

reversedNames = names.sorted() { $0 > $1 }

// If a closure expression is provided as the function or method’s only argument and you provide that expression as a trailing closure, you do not need to write a pair of parentheses () after the function or method’s name when you call the function:
reversedNames = names.sorted { $0 > $1 }

// Trailing closures are most useful when the closure is sufficiently long that it is not possible to write it inline on a single line. As an example, Swift’s Array type has a map(_:) method which takes a closure expression as its single argument. The closure is called once for each item in the array, and returns an alternative mapped value (possibly of some other type) for that item. The nature of the mapping and the type of the returned value is left up to the closure to specify.
// After applying the provided closure to each array element, the map(_:) method returns a new array containing all of the new mapped values, in the same order as their corresponding values in the original array.
let digitNames = [
    0: "Zero", 1: "One", 2: "Two",   3: "Three", 4: "Four",
    5: "Five", 6: "Six", 7: "Seven", 8: "Eight", 9: "Nine"
]
let numbers = [16, 58, 510]

let strings = numbers.map { (number) -> String in
    var number = number
    var output = ""
    repeat {
        output = digitNames[number % 10]! + output
        number /= 10
    } while number > 0
    return output
}
// The map(_:) method calls the closure expression once for each item in the array. You do not need to specify the type of the closure’s input parameter, number, because the type can be inferred from the values in the array to be mapped.
// In this example, the variable number is initialized with the value of the closure’s number parameter, so that the value can be modified within the closure body. (The parameters to functions and closures are always constants.) The closure expression also specifies a return type of String, to indicate the type that will be stored in the mapped output array.
// The call to the digitNames dictionary’s subscript is followed by an exclamation mark (!), because dictionary subscripts return an optional value to indicate that the dictionary lookup can fail if the key does not exist. In the example above, it is guaranteed that number % 10 will always be a valid subscript key for the digitNames dictionary, and so an exclamation mark is used to force-unwrap the String value stored in the subscript’s optional return value.

// A closure can capture constants and variables from the surrounding context in which it is defined. The closure can then refer to and modify the values of those constants and variables from within its body, even if the original scope that defined the constants and variables no longer exists.
func makeIncrementer(forIncrement amount: Int) -> () -> Int {
    var runningTotal = 0
    func incrementer() -> Int {
        runningTotal += amount
        return runningTotal
    }
    return incrementer
}
let incrementByTen = makeIncrementer(forIncrement: 10)
incrementByTen()
incrementByTen()
incrementByTen()
let incrementBySeven = makeIncrementer(forIncrement: 7)
incrementBySeven()
// As an optimization, Swift may instead capture and store a copy of a value if that value is not mutated by a closure, and if the value is not mutated after the closure is created.
// Swift also handles all memory management involved in disposing of variables when they are no longer needed.

// If you assign a closure to a property of a class instance, and the closure captures that instance by referring to the instance or its members, you will create a strong reference cycle between the closure and the instance. Swift uses capture lists to break these strong reference cycles. For more information, see Strong Reference Cycles for Closures.

// In the example above, incrementBySeven and incrementByTen are constants, but the closures these constants refer to are still able to increment the runningTotal variables that they have captured. This is because functions and closures are reference types.
// Whenever you assign a function or a closure to a constant or a variable, you are actually setting that constant or variable to be a reference to the function or closure. In the example above, it is the choice of closure that incrementByTen refers to that is constant, and not the contents of the closure itself.

// This also means that if you assign a closure to two different constants or variables, both of those constants or variables will refer to the same closure:
let alsoIncrementByTen = incrementByTen
alsoIncrementByTen()

// A closure is said to escape a function when the closure is passed as an argument to the function, but is called after the function returns. When you declare a function that takes a closure as one of its parameters, you can write @escaping before the parameter’s type to indicate that the closure is allowed to escape.
// One way that a closure can escape is by being stored in a variable that is defined outside the function. As an example, many functions that start an asynchronous operation take a closure argument as a completion handler. The function returns after it starts the operation, but the closure isn’t called until the operation is completed—the closure needs to escape, to be called later. For example:
var completionHandlers: [() -> Void] = []
func someFunctionWithEscapingClosure(completionHandler: @escaping () -> Void) {
    completionHandlers.append(completionHandler)
}

// Marking a closure with @escaping means you have to refer to self explicitly within the closure. For example, in the code below, the closure passed to someFunctionWithEscapingClosure(_:) is an escaping closure, which means it needs to refer to self explicitly. In contrast, the closure passed to someFunctionWithNonescapingClosure(_:) is a nonescaping closure, which means it can refer to self implicitly.
func someFunctionWithNonescapingClosure(closure: () -> Void) {
    closure()
}

class SomeClass {
    var x = 10
    func doSomething() {
        someFunctionWithEscapingClosure { self.x = 100 }
        someFunctionWithNonescapingClosure { x = 200 }
    }
}

let instance = SomeClass()
instance.doSomething()
print(instance.x)

completionHandlers.first?()
print(instance.x)

// An autoclosure is a closure that is automatically created to wrap an expression that’s being passed as an argument to a function. It doesn’t take any arguments, and when it’s called, it returns the value of the expression that’s wrapped inside of it. This syntactic convenience lets you omit braces around a function’s parameter by writing a normal expression instead of an explicit closure.
// It’s common to call functions that take autoclosures, but it’s not common to implement that kind of function. For example, the assert(condition:message:file:line:) function takes an autoclosure for its condition and message parameters; its condition parameter is evaluated only in debug builds and its message parameter is evaluated only if condition is false.
// An autoclosure lets you delay evaluation, because the code inside isn’t run until you call the closure. Delaying evaluation is useful for code that has side effects or is computationally expensive, because it lets you control when that code is evaluated. The code below shows how a closure delays evaluation.
var customersInLine = ["Chris", "Alex", "Ewa", "Barry", "Daniella"]
print(customersInLine.count)

let customerProvider = { customersInLine.remove(at: 0) }
print(customersInLine.count)

print("Now serving \(customerProvider())!")
print(customersInLine.count)

// You get the same behavior of delayed evaluation when you pass a closure as an argument to a function.
func serve(customer customerProvider: () -> String) {
    print("Now serving \(customerProvider())!")
}
serve(customer: { customersInLine.remove(at: 0) } )

// The serve(customer:) function in the listing above takes an explicit closure that returns a customer’s name. The version of serve(customer:) below performs the same operation but, instead of taking an explicit closure, it takes an autoclosure by marking its parameter’s type with the @autoclosure attribute. Now you can call the function as if it took a String argument instead of a closure. The argument is automatically converted to a closure, because the customerProvider parameter’s type is marked with the @autoclosure attribute.
func serve(customer customerProvider: @autoclosure () -> String) {
    print("Now serving \(customerProvider())!")
}
serve(customer: customersInLine.remove(at: 0))

// If you want an autoclosure that is allowed to escape, use both the @autoclosure and @escaping attributes.
var customerProviders: [() -> String] = []
func collectCustomerProviders(_ customerProvider: @autoclosure @escaping () -> String) {
    customerProviders.append(customerProvider)
}
collectCustomerProviders(customersInLine.remove(at: 0))
collectCustomerProviders(customersInLine.remove(at: 0))

print("Collected \(customerProviders.count) closures.")
for customerProvider in customerProviders {
    print("Now serving \(customerProvider())!")
}
