// You can use tuples to test multiple values in the same switch statement. Each element of the tuple can be tested against a different value or interval of values. Alternatively, use the underscore character (_), also known as the wildcard pattern, to match any possible value.

// Unlike C, Swift allows multiple switch cases to consider the same value or values. In fact, the point (0, 0) could match all four of the cases in this example. However, if multiple matches are possible, the first matching case is always used. The point (0, 0) would match case (0, 0) first, and so all other matching cases would be ignored.


// A switch case can name the value or values it matches to temporary constants or variables, for use in the body of the case. This behavior is known as value binding, because the values are bound to temporary constants or variables within the case’s body.

}

// Compound cases can also include value bindings. All of the patterns of a compound case have to include the same set of value bindings, and each binding has to get a value of the same type from all of the patterns in the compound case. This ensures that, no matter which part of the compound case matched, the code in the body of the case can always access a value for the bindings and that the value always has the same type.

// It is not strictly necessary to use the gameLoop label when calling continue gameLoop to jump to the next iteration of the loop. There is only one loop in the game, and therefore no ambiguity as to which loop the continue statement will affect. However, there is no harm in using the gameLoop label with the continue statement. Doing so is consistent with the label’s use alongside the break statement and helps make the game’s logic clearer to read and understand.

// You use an availability condition in an if or guard statement to conditionally execute a block of code, depending on whether the APIs you want to use are available at runtime.

// The availability condition above specifies that in iOS, the body of the if statement executes only in iOS 10 and later; in macOS, only in macOS 10.12 and later.

// In addition to specifying major version numbers like iOS 8 or macOS 10.10, you can specify minor versions numbers like iOS 8.3 and macOS 10.10.3.
