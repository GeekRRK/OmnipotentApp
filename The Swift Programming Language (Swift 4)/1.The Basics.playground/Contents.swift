 Double represents a 64-bit floating-point number.
 Float represents a 32-bit floating-point number.
 Double has a precision of at least 15 decimal digits, whereas the precision of Float can be as little as 6 decimal digits. The appropriate floating-point type to use depends on the nature and range of values you need to work with in your code. In situations where either type would be appropriate, Double is preferred.

/*
 Integer literals can be written as:
 
 A decimal number, with no prefix
 A binary number, with a 0b prefix
 An octal number, with a 0o prefix
 A hexadecimal number, with a 0x prefix
 */

/*
 Decimal floats can also have an optional exponent, indicated by an uppercase or lowercase e; hexadecimal floats must have an exponent, indicated by an uppercase or lowercase p.
 
 For decimal numbers with an exponent of exp, the base number is multiplied by 10exp:
 1.25e2 means 1.25 x 102, or 125.0.
 1.25e-2 means 1.25 x 10-2, or 0.0125.
 
 For hexadecimal numbers with an exponent of exp, the base number is multiplied by 2exp:
 0xFp2 means 15 x 22, or 60.0.
 0xFp-2 means 15 x 2-2, or 3.75.

// Assertions help you find mistakes and incorrect assumptions during development, and preconditions help you detect issues in production.
// The difference between assertions and preconditions is in when they are checked: Assertions are checked only in debug builds, but preconditions are checked in both debug and production builds. In production builds, the condition inside an assertion isn‚Äôt evaluated. This means you can use as many assertions as you want during your development process, without impacting the performance in production.

// assert(_:_:file:line:)
let age = -3
assert(age >= 0, "A person's age can't be less than zero.")

// If the code already checks the condition, you use the assertionFailure(_:file:line:) function to indicate that an assertion has failed. For example:
if age > 10 {
    print("You can ride the roller-coaster or the ferris wheel.")
} else if age > 0 {
    print("You can ride the ferris wheel.")
} else {
    assertionFailure("A person's age can't be less than zero.")
}

// Use a precondition whenever a condition has the potential to be false, but must definitely be true for your code to continue execution. For example, use a precondition to check that a subscript is not out of bounds, or to check that a function has been passed a valid value.
// precondition(_:_:file:line:)
let index = -1
precondition(index > 0, "Index must be greater than zero.")

// You can also call the preconditionFailure(_:file:line:) function to indicate that a failure has occurred‚Äîfor example, if the default case of a switch was taken, but all valid input data should have been handled by one of the switch‚Äôs other cases.

// If you compile in unchecked mode (-Ounchecked), preconditions are not checked. The compiler assumes that preconditions are always true, and it optimizes your code accordingly. However, the fatalError(_:file:line:) function always halts execution, regardless of optimization settings.

// You can use the fatalError(_:file:line:) function during prototyping and early development to create stubs for functionality that hasn‚Äôt been implemented yet, by writing fatalError("Unimplemented") as the stub implementation. Because fatal errors are never optimized out, unlike assertions or preconditions, you can be sure that execution always halts if it encounters a stub implementation.
