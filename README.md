# OmnipotentApp
This project is for learning Swift and Storyboard. My aim is to build an omnipotent
App which contains some tech that be used frequently. So when I start a new project,
I don't need to start from scratch. The omnipotent App will be updated aperiodically.  

Updates:
* Skeleton which contains tab bar controller and navigation controller.
