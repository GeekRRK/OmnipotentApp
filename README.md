# OmnipotentApp
This project is for learning Swift and Storyboard. My aim is to build an omnipotent
App which contains some tech that be used frequently. So when I start a new project,
I don't need to start from scratch. The omnipotent App will be updated aperiodically.  

Updates:
* Skeleton which contains tab bar controller and navigation controller.  

* Login UI which is concise but not boring.  

* Scrolling Ad on the top of homepage with transparent navigation bar.  

* Sliding drawer.  

* Launch counting or sliding Ad.
