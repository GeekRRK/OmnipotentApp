// Nested multiline comments enable you to comment out large blocks of code quickly and easily, even if the code already contains multiline comments.

let cat = "üê±"; print(cat)

let minValue = UInt8.min  // minValue is equal to 0, and is of type UInt8
let maxValue = UInt8.max  // maxValue is equal to 255, and is of type UInt8

// Double represents a 64-bit floating-point number.
// Float represents a 32-bit floating-point number.
// Double has a precision of at least 15 decimal digits, whereas the precision of Float can be as little as 6 decimal digits. The appropriate floating-point type to use depends on the nature and range of values you need to work with in your code. In situations where either type would be appropriate, Double is preferred.
